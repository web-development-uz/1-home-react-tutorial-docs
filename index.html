 <h1>Tutorial: Intro to React</h1>
 <h3>Before We Start the Tutorial</h3>
 <p>We will build a small game during this tutorial. You might be tempted to <del>skip it because you’re not building games</del> — but give it a chance. The <ins>techniques</ins> you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React app, and mastering it will give you a deep understanding of React<sup>22</sup>.</p>
 <h4>Tip</h4>
 <mark>This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to <b>learn by doing</b>. If you prefer learning concepts from the ground up, check out our <i>step-by-step guide.</i> You might find this tutorial and the guide complementary to each other.</mark>
 <h2>The tutorial is divided into several sections:</h2>
 <p>*Setup for the Tutorial will give you a <b>starting point</b> to follow the tutorial.</p>
 <p>*Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React<sup>22</sup>: components, props, and state.
 <p>*Completing the Game will teach you the most common techniques in React<sub>development</sub>.
 <p>*Adding <abbr title="Mono Time Travel Home">MTTH</abbr> will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React<sub><b>libarary</b></sub>.
 <hr/>
 <p>You don’t have to complete all of the <b>sections at once to <i>get the value</i> out</b> of this tutorial. Try to get as far as you can — even if it’s one or two sections.</p>
 <h2>What Are We Building?</h2>
 <p><b>In this tutorial</b>, we’ll show how to build an interactive <i>tic-tac-toe</i> game with React<sup><mark>libarary</mark></sup>.</p>
 <p>You can see what we’ll be building here: <b>Final Result.</b> If the code doesn’t make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.</p>
 <p>We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.</p>
 <p>You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it. We’ll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.</p>
 <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
 <p>We’ll assume that you have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language. We’ll also assume that you’re familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.</p>
 <p>If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading this guide. Note that we’re also using some features from ES6 — a recent version of JavaScript. In this tutorial, we’re using arrow <markfunctions</mark>, classes, <b>let</b>, and <b>const</b> <mark>statements</mark>. You can use the <mark>Babel REPL</mark> to check what ES6 code compiles to.</p>

 <h2>Setup for the Tutorial</h2>
 <p>There are two ways to complete this tutorial: you can either write the code in your browser, or you can set up a local development environment on your computer.</p>
 <h3>Setup Option 1: Write Code in the Browser</h3>
 <i>This is the quickest way to get started!</i>
 <p>First, open this <mark>Starter Code</mark> in a new tab. The new tab should display an empty <b>tic-tac-toe</b> game board and React code. We will be editing the React code in this tutorial.</p>
 <p>You can now skip the second setup option, and go to the <b>Overview section</b> to get an overview of React<sup>library</sup>.</p>
 <h2>Overview</h2>
 <i>Now that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of React!</i>
 <h3>What Is React?</h3>
 <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex <abbr title="user interface">UIs</abbr> from small and isolated pieces of code called <mark>“components”</mark>.</p>
 <hr/> 
 <p>We’ll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React <sup><mark>will efficiently update</mark></sup> and re-render our components.</p>

 <p>Here, ShoppingList is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.</p>
 <p>The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write.</p> 
 <p>The syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div'). </p>
 <i>The example above is equivalent to</i>
 <h3>Passing Data Through Props</h3>
 <p>To get our feet wet, let’s try passing some data from our Board component to our Square component.</p>
 <p>We strongly recommend typing code by hand as you’re working through the tutorial and not using copy/paste. <mark>This will help you develop</mark> muscle memory and a stronger understanding.</p>
 <h1>Completing the Game</h1>
 <p>We now have the basic building blocks for our tic-tac-toe game. To have a complete game, we now need to alternate <mark>placing “X”s and “O”s on the board</mark>, and we need a way to determine a winner.</p>
 <h2>Lifting State Up</h2>
 <p>Currently, each Square component maintains the game’s state.</p> 
 <p>To check for a winner, we’ll maintain the value of each of the 9 squares in one location.</p>
 <p>We may think that Board should just ask each Square for the Square’s state. <i>Although this approach is possible</i> in React, we discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to bugs, and hard to refactor. Instead, the best approach is to store the game’s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square. The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, just like we did when we passed a number to each Square.</p>
 <p><b>To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, you need to declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass the state back down to the children by using props; this keeps the child components in sync with each other and with the parent component.</b></p>
 <p>Lifting state into a parent component is common when React <mark><sub>components are refactored</sub></mark> — let’s take this opportunity to try it out.</p>
 <p>Add a constructor to the Board and set the Board’s initial state to contain an array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares:</p>
 <hr/> 
 <h1>Why Immutability Is Important</h1>
 <p>In the previous code <i>example, we suggested that you use the</i> .slice() method to create a copy of the squares array to copy instead of modifying the existing array. We’ll now discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.</p>
 <p>There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to <b><i>mutate the data by directly changing</i></b> the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes.</p>
